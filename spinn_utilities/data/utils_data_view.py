    """
    A read only view of the data available at each level

    All methods are class methods so can be accessed directly without
    instantiating a view.
    There is a stack of subclasses such as MachineDatView, FecDataView,
    SpynnakerDataView (and more). All inherit all methods.
    We reserve the right to override methods defined in one View in subclasses.

    There are also Writer classes which override the Views but these are
    specifically designed to only be usable in unittests and by the simulator
    (ASB) directly.

    You should use the data view most appropriate to what you are doing i.e.
    If you are accessing it from a class or function in FEC,
    use FecDataView but if you are accessing it from Spynnaker,
    use SpynnakerDataView.
    This will ensure that any changes to the view local to the code will
    affect all code in that package

    The objects accessed this way should not be changed or added to.
    Changing or adding to any object accessed is unsupported as bypasses any
    check or updates done in the writer(s).
    Objects returned could be changed to immutable versions without notice!

    The get... methods will either return a valid value or
    raise an Exception if the data is currently not available.
    The get methods will will not return None unless specifically documented
    to do so.
    As a reasonable effort is made the setters to verify the data types,
    the get methods can be expected to return the correct type.

    There are also several semantic sugar get.. methods.
    Some are slightly faster but many are just to make the code more readable.
    Some semantic sugar methods do not start with get to keep the same name as
    the existing function on the object has.

    The iterate... methods offer a view over the collections within
    mutable data objects, particularly ones changed between runs.
    There is no guarantee if the returned iterator will or will not reflect
    any changes to the underlying data object,
    nor that how a method behaves in this way does not change over time.
    So the methods should be called for every iteration.

    Each iterate.. method will have a corresponding get_n.. which you need to
    do instead of len(iterate..) as we reserve the right to make any iterate
    method return an iterable which does not support len without notice.

    add... methods allow for the scripts directly or indirectly to add extra
    values.
    They allow the view to add extra safetly such as type checking.
    They will raise an exception if called while the simulator is running.

    The has... methods will return True if the value is known and False if not.
    Semantically they are the same as checking if the get raises an exception.
    They may be faster if the object needs to be generated on the fly or
    protected to be made immutable.
    Has methods have been added where needed.
    More can easily be added if required.

    The is... methods will return a bool value to say teh simulator is in
    the expected state.
    They may throw an exception if called at an unexpected time.
    For example if called before sim.setup or after sim.end

    While how and where the underpinning DataModel(s) store data can change
    without notice, methods in View classes can be considered a supported API
