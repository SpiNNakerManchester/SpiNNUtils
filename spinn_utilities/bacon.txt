2:We do what we must because we can For the good of all of us:
2:Except the ones who are dead. But there's no sense crying  :
2:over every mistake. You just keep on trying till you run   :

2:glad I'm not you. I've experiments to run. There is        :
2:research to be done. On the people who are still alive. And:
2:believe me I am still alive. I'm doing science and I'm     :
2:still alive. I feel fantastic and I'm still alive. While   :
2:you're dying I'll be still alive. And when you're dead I   :
2:will be still alive...... Still alive.....Still alive!!!!!!:

3:wife, Daisy, Daisy! "Ped'ling" away down the road of life, :
3:I and my Daisy Bell! When the road's dark we can both      :
3:despise P'liceman and "lamps" as well; There are "bright   :
3:lights" in the dazzling eyes Of beautiful Daisy Bell! I    :
