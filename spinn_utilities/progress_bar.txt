2:This was a triumph! I'm making a note here Huge Success!!! :
2:It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. Aperture Science   :
2:We do what we must because we can For the good of all of us:
2:Except the ones who are dead. But there's no sense crying  :
2:over every mistake. You just keep on trying till you run   :
2:out of cake. And the science gets done. And you make a neat:
2:gun for the people are still alive. I'm not even angry.....:
2:I'm being so sincere right now. Even through you broke my  :
2:heart, and killed me. And tore me to pieces. And threw     :
2:every piece into a fire. As they burned it hurt because    :
2:I was so happy for you! Now, these points of data make a   :
2:beautiful line. And we're out of beta. We're releasing on  :
2:time! So I'm GLaD I got burned! Think of all the things we :
2:learned! for the people who are still alive. Go ahead and  :
2:leave me... I think I'd perfer to stay inside... Maybe you :
2:will find someone else to help you. Maybe Black Mesa? That :
2:was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance! Anyway this cake is great!  :
2:It's so delicious and moist! Look at me  still talking when:
2:there's science to do! When I look out there, it makes me  :
2:glad I'm not you. I've experiments to run. There is        :
2:research to be done. On the people who are still alive. And:
2:believe me I am still alive. I'm doing science and I'm     :
2:still alive. I feel fantastic and I'm still alive. While   :
2:you're dying I'll be still alive. And when you're dead I   :
2:will be still alive...... Still alive.....Still alive!!!!!!:
3:There is a flower within my heart, Daisy, Daisy! Planted   :
3:one day by a glancing dart, Planted by Daisy Bell! Whether :
3:she loves me or loves me not, Sometimes it's hard to tell; :
3:Yet I am longing to share the lot Of beautiful Daisy Bell! :
3:Daisy, Daisy, Give me your answer, do! I'm half crazy, All :
3:for the love of you! It won't be a stylish marriage, I     :
3:can't afford a carriage, But you'll look sweet on the seat :
3:Of a bicycle built for two! We will go "tandem" as man and :
3:wife, Daisy, Daisy! "Ped'ling" away down the road of life, :
3:I and my Daisy Bell! When the road's dark we can both      :
3:despise P'liceman and "lamps" as well; There are "bright   :
3:lights" in the dazzling eyes Of beautiful Daisy Bell! I    :
3:will stand by you in "wheel" or woe, Daisy, Daisy! You'll  :
3:be the bell(e) which I'll ring you know! Sweet little Daisy:
3:Bell! You'll take the "lead" in each "trip" we take, Then  :
3:if I don't do well; I will permit you to use the brake, My :
3:beautiful Daisy Bell!                                      :
